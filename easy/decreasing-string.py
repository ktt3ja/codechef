# Statement
# 
# You need to find a string which has exactly K positions in it such that the
# character at that position comes alphabetically later than the character
# immediately after it. If there are many such strings, print the one which
# has the shortest length. If there is still a tie, print the string which
# comes the lexicographically earliest (would occur earlier in a dictionary).
#
# Input
# The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each test case contains
# n integer K (â‰¤ 100).
#
# Output
# Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required string. Use
# only lower-case letters a-z.
#
# Sample Input
# 2
# 1
# 2
#
# Sample Output
# ba
# cba
